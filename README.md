# sketches-in-gym-control

This code accompanies a Medium blog series on RL-Free Classic Control.  It is a work in progress!  I intend to add new examples alongside new posts as time permits.

All are welcome to open issues or pull requests.

Minimal conda setup follows.

```
conda env create -n my-env python=3.8
conda activate my-env
conda env update -f env.yaml
pip install -e .
```
